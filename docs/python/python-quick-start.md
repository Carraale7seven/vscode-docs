# Quick Start Guide for Python in VS Code

The Python extension makes VS Code an excellent Python editor, works on any operating system, and is usable with a variety of Python interpreters.

Get started by installing:
-	[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-	[A Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter) (any [actively supported Python version](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches))
-	[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) from the VS Code Marketplace

To further customize VS Code for Python, you can leverage the [Python profile template](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles#_python-profile-template), automatically installing recommended extensions and settings. For Data Scientists, consider using the [Data Science profile template](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles#_data-science-profile-template).

## How to create and open a Python project or file
-	[Open an existing Python project](/docs/python/python-quick-start.md/#open-an-existing-python-project-or-file)
-	[Create new Python scripts](/docs/python/python-quick-start.md#create-new-python-scripts)
-	[Clone a Python project from version control](/docs/python/python-quick-start.md#clone-a-python-project-from-version-control)

### Open an existing Python project or file

If you have an existing Python project you wish to work on in VS Code, you can begin by opening your folder or file from the VS Code welcome page or Explorer panel, or by selecting **File -> Open Folder** (Ctrl+K Ctrl+O) or **File -> Open File** (Ctrl+O).

### Create new Python scripts

If you are starting a new Python script, you can create Python files directly in VS Code. You can create a new Python file by selecting **New File** in the VS Code Welcome page and select **Python file**, or navigating to **File -> New File** (ADD SHORTCUT).

If you already have a workspace folder open in VS Code, you can add new files or folders directly into your existing project. You can create new folders and file by clicking the icons on the top level folder in the Explorer panel.

### Clone a Python project from version control

If you have an existing Python project in version control, you can clone it locally by selecting **Clone Git Repository** in the VS Code Welcome page, or by selecting **Clone Repository** in the Explorer panel.

## UI Tour

When you launch VS Code for the very first time, you will need to install the Python extension to get full Python support and UI. Letâ€™s look at the UI once the Python extension is installed.

## Code Actions

Code Actions (also known as Quick Fixes) are provided by Warnings or Errors to help fix issues you may be experiencing in your code. These helpful hints are displayed in the editor left margin as a lightbulb (ðŸ’¡). Click on the light bulb to display Code Action options which can come from extensions such as Python, Pylance, or VS Code itself. For more information about Code Actions, see [Python Quick Fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_quick-fixes).

## Python Commands

Python commands can be accessed through the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). From the Command Palette, you have access to the full functionality of VS Code, but for Python specific functionality begin typing **â€œPython: â€œ** to locate the commands accessible through the Python extension.

## Run, debug, and test

Now that you are more familiar with Python in VS Code, letâ€™s learn how to run, debug, and test your code.

### Run

There are a few ways to run Python code in VS Code.

To run the active Python file, click the **Run Python File in Terminal** play button in the top-right side of the editor.

![Image showing the Run Python File in Terminal play button.](images/tutorial/run-python-file-in-terminal-button.png)

There are three other ways you can run Python code within VS Code:
-	Right-click anywhere in the editor window and select **Run > Python File** in Terminal (which saves the file automatically):
![Image showing the Python run options in the context menu.](images/tutorial/run-python-file-in-terminal.png)
-	Select one or more lines, then press `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` or right-click and select **Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal**. This command is convenient for testing just a part of a file.
-	From the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), select the **Python: Start REPL** command to open a REPL terminal for the currently selected Python interpreter. In the REPL, you can then enter and run lines of code one at a time.

### Debug

Debugging starts by setting breakpoints in your Python project. This will allow you to explore data as it moves through your program. You can set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter of the line, where a red dot will appear.

To start debugging, initialize the debugger by pressing `F5`. Since this is your first time debugging this file, a configuration menu will open from the Command Palette allowing you to select the type of debug configuration you would like for the opened file or project.

The program will stop at the breakpoint you set, and you can track data in the Python Debug console, and progress through your program using the debug toolbar.

![Gif showing how to configure the Python debugger for the first time.](images/quick-start/qs-python-debug.gif)

After selecting a debug configuration, you can also start the debugger by clicking on the down-arrow next to the run button on the editor and selecting **Debug Python File in Terminal**.

For a deeper dive into Python debugging functionality, see [Python debugging in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging).

### Test
The Python extension provides robust testing support for [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html) and [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/7.4.x/).

You can configure Python tests through the Test Panel on the Activity Bar by selecting **Configure Python Tests** and selecting your test framework of choice.

You can also create tests for your Python project, which the Python extension will attempt to discovery once your framework of choice is configured. The Python extension also allows you to run and debug your tests in the Testing panel and view testing output in the Test Results panel.

For a comprehensive look at testing functionality, see [Python testing in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing).
